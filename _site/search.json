This storage is located on disks that are physically attached to the host computer. Instance store is ideal for temporary storage of information that changes frequently, such as buffers, caches, scratch data, and other temporary content, or for data that is replicated across a fleet of instances, such as a load-balanced pool of web servers.\n\nInstance store volumes cannot be stopped. If the underlying host fails, you will lose your data.\n\nAn ‚ÄúEBS-backed‚Äù instance is an EC2 instance which uses an EBS volume as it‚Äôs root device. EBS volumes are redundant, ‚Äúvirtual‚Äù drives, which are not tied to any particular hardware, however they are restricted to a particular EC2 availability zone. This means that an EBS volume can move from one piece of hardware to another within the same availability zone. You can think of EBS volumes as a kind of Network Attached Storage.\nIf the virtual machine‚Äôs hardware fails, the EBS volume can simply be moved to another virtual machine and re-launched. In theory, you won‚Äôt lose any data.\nAnother benefit is that EBS volumes can easily be backed up and duplicated. So you can take easy backup snapshots of your volumes, create new volumes and launch new EC2 instances based on those duplicate volumes.\n\nEBS backed instances can be stopped. You won‚Äôt lose the data on this instance if it is stopped.\nBy default, both root volumes will be deleted on termination. However, with EBS volumes, you can tell AWS to keep the device volume."

If a record set fails a health check it will be removed from Route53 until it passes the health check. We can set SNS notifications to alert you if health check is failing.\n\nSimple Routing Policy\n\nOne record with multiple IP addresses. If you specify multiple values in a record, Route53 returns all values to the user in a random order.\n\nWeighted Routing Policy\n\nAllows you split your traffic based on different weights assigned. For example, you can set 10% of your traffict to go to US-EAST-1 and 90% to EU-WEST-1.\n\nLetancy Routing Policy\n\nAllows you to route your traffic based on the lowest network latency for your end user (ie which region will give them the fastest response time).\nTo use latency-based routing, we need to create a latency resource record set for EC2 or ELB resource in each region that hosts your website.\n\nFallover Routing Policy\n\nThis is used when you want to create an active/passive set up. For example, you may want your primary site to be in EU-WEST-2 and your secondary DR Site in AP-SOUTHEAST-2. Route53 will monitor the health or your primary site using health checks.\n\nGeolocation Routing Policy\n\nDepending on our final users location.\n\nGeoproximity Routing Policy (Traffict Flow Only)\n\nGeoproximity routing lets Route53 route traffic to your resources based on the geographic location of your users and your resources. You can also optionally choose to route more traffic or less to a given resource by specifying a value, known as a bias. A bias expands or shrinks the size of the geographic region from which traffic ir routed to a resource.\n\nMultivalue Answer Policy\n\nIt lets you configure Route53 to return multiple values, such as IP addresses for your web servers, in response to DNS queries. You can specify multiple values for almost any record, but multivalue answer routing also lets you check the health of each resource, so Route53 returns only values for healthy resources.\nSimilar to simple routing but with health checks on each record set."

For this, we need to make our private instance a NAT instance. This NAT instance will communicate with a NAT Gateway, so we need to change the source/destination check in order to replace the ‚Äúinternet‚Äù gateway by our NAT gateway‚Äù.\nThen, we need to go to VPC &gt; Create NAT Gateway &gt; Create. Then, select the public subnet and create a elastic IP address. Finally, we need to go to VPC &gt; Routes and add a route to route all the IP addresses to a NAT gateway.\nAbout NAT instance:\n\nNAT instances must be in a public subnet.\nThere must be a route out of the private subnet to the NAT instance, in order for this to work.\nThe amount of traffict that NAT instances can support depends on the instance size. If you are bottlenecking, increase the instance size.\nYou can create high availability using autoscaling groups, multiple subnets in different AZs, and a script to automate failover.\n\nAbout NAT gateway:\n\nNAT Gateways are redundant inside the Availability Zone. One NAT gateway per availability zone.\nPreferred by the enterprise.\nStarts at 5Gbps and scales currently up to 45 Gbps.\nNo need to patch\nNot associated with security groups.\nAutomatically assigned a public IP address.\nNo needed to disable the source/destination check.\nIn order to have high availability, we should create a NAT gateway in each availability zone.\n\n\n\nBastion\n\nA Bastion is used to securely administer EC2 instances (using ssh or RDP. Bastions are called Jump Boxes in Australia).\nWe cannot use a NAT Gateway as a Bastion host.\n\n\n\nDirect Connect\nAWS Direct Connect is a cloud service solution that makes it easy to establish a dedicated network connection from your premises to AWS. Therefore, we can establish private connectivity between AWS and your datacenter, office, or colocation environment, which in many cases can reduce your network costs, increase bandwidth throughput and provide a more consistent network experience than Internet-based connections.\n\n\nVPC Endpoint\nAn interface endpoint is an elastic network interface with a private IP address that serves as an entry point for traffic destined to a supported service.\nA VPC endpoint enables you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services and VPC endpoint services powered by PrivateLink without requiring an internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection or AWS Direct Connection. Instances in your VPC do not require public IP addresses to communicate with resources in the service. Traffic between your VPC and the other service does not have the Amazon network.\nEndpoints are virtual devices. They are horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC components that allow communication between instances in your VPC and services without imposing availability risks or bandwidth constrains on your network traffic.\n\nThere are two types: interface and gateway\nCurrently, gateway endpoints support S3 and DynamoDB"

    "text": "Why cybersecurity is important\nCybersecurity is important because cyberattacks and cybercrime have the power to disrupt, damage or destroy businesses, communities and lives. Successful cyberattacks lead to identity theft, personal and corporate extortion, loss of sensitive information and business-critical data, temporary business outages, lost business and lost customers and, in some cases, business closures.\nCyberattacks have an enormous and growing impact on businesses and the economy. By one estimate, cybercrime will cost the world economy USD 10.5 trillion per year by 2025.The cost of cyberattacks continues to rise as cybercriminals become more sophisticated.\nAccording to IBM‚Äôs latest Cost of a Data Breach Report:\n\nThe average cost of a data breach jumped to USD 4.88 million from USD 4.45 million in 2023‚Äîa 10% spike and the highest increase since the pandemic.\n\n\n\nBusiness losses (revenue loss due to system downtime, lost customers and reputational damage) and post-breach response costs (costs to set up call centers and credit monitoring services for affected customers or to pay regulatory fines), rose nearly 11% over the previous year.\nThe number of organizations paying more than USD 50,000 in regulatory fines as a result of a data breach rose 22.7% over the previous year; those paying more than USD 100,000 rose 19.5%."

    "text": "Cybersecurity challenges\nApart from the sheer volume of cyberattacks, one of the biggest challenges for cybersecurity professionals is the ever-evolving nature of the information technology (IT) landscape, and the way threats evolve with it. Many emerging technologies that offer tremendous new advantages for businesses and individuals also present new opportunities for threat actors and cybercriminals to launch increasingly sophisticated attacks. For example:\n\nThe pervasive adoption of cloud computing can increase network management complexity and raise the risk of cloud misconfigurations, improperly secured APIs and other avenues hackers can exploit.\n\n\n\nMore remote work, hybrid work and bring-your-own-device (BYOD) policies mean more connections, devices, applications and data for security teams to protect.\n\n\n\nProliferating¬†Internet of Things (IoT) and connected devices, many of which are unsecured or improperly secured by default, can be easily hijacked by bad actors.\nThe rise of artificial intelligence (AI), and of generative AI in particular, presents an entirely new threat landscape that hackers are already exploiting through prompt injection and other techniques. According to recent research from the IBM¬Æ Institute for Business Value, only 24% of generative AI initiatives are secured.\n\nAs the worldwide attack surface expands, the cybersecurity workforce is struggling to keep pace. A World Economic Forum study found that the global cybersecurity worker gap‚Äîthe gap between cybersecurity workers and jobs that need to be filled‚Äîmight reach 85 million workers by 2030.\nClosing this skills gap can have an impact. According to the Cost of a Data Breach 2024 Report, organizations suffering from a high-level shortage of security skills saw an average cost per breach of USD 5.74 million, compared to USD 3.98 million for organizations with lower-level skills shortages.\nResource-strained security teams will increasingly turn to security technologies featuring advanced analytics, artificial intelligence (AI) and automation to strengthen their cyber defenses and minimize the impact of successful attacks."

    "section": "Types of cybersecurity",
    "text": "Types of cybersecurity\nComprehensive cybersecurity strategies protect all of an organization‚Äôs IT infrastructure layers against cyberthreats and cybercrime. Some of the most important cybersecurity domains include:\n\nAI security\nCritical infrastructure security\nNetwork security\nEndpoint security\nApplication security\nCloud security\nInformation security\nMobile security\n\n\nAI security\nAI security refers to measures and technology aimed at preventing or mitigating cyberthreats and cyberattacks that target AI applications or systems or that use AI in malicious ways.\nGenerative AI offers threat actors new attack vectors to exploit. Hackers can use malicious prompts to manipulate AI apps, poison data sources to distort AI outputs and even trick AI tools into sharing sensitive information. They can also use (and have already used) generative AI to create malicious code and phishing emails.\nAI security uses specialized risk management frameworks‚Äîand increasingly, AI-enabled cybersecurity tools‚Äîto protect the AI attack surface. According to the Cost of a Data Breach 2024 Report, organizations that deployed AI-enabled security tools and automation extensively for cyberthreat prevention saw a USD 2.2 million lower average cost per breach compared to organizations with no AI deployed.\n\n\nCritical infrastructure security\nCritical infrastructure security protects the computer systems, applications, networks, data and digital assets that a society depends on for national security, economic health and public safety.\nIn the United States, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) offers a cybersecurity framework to help IT providers and stakeholders secure critical infrastructure. The US Department of Homeland Security‚Äôs Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) also provides guidance.\n\n\nNetwork security\nNetwork security focuses on preventing unauthorized access to networks and network resources. It also helps ensure that authorized users have secure and reliable access to the resources and assets they need to do their jobs.\n\n\nApplication security\nApplication security helps prevent unauthorized access to and use of apps and related data. It also helps identify and mitigate flaws or vulnerabilities in application design. Modern application development methods such as¬†DevOps and DevSecOps¬†build security and security testing into the development process.\n\n\nCloud security\nCloud security secures an organization‚Äôs cloud-based services and assets, including applications, data, virtual servers and other infrastructure.\nGenerally speaking, cloud security operates on the shared responsibility model. The cloud provider is responsible for securing the services that they deliver and the infrastructure that delivers them. The customer is responsible for protecting their data, code and other assets they store or run in the cloud.\n\n\nInformation security and data security\nInformation security (InfoSec) protects an organization‚Äôs important information‚Äîdigital files and data, paper documents, physical media‚Äîagainst unauthorized access, use or alteration.\nData security, the protection of digital information, is a subset of information security and the focus of most cybersecurity-related InfoSec measures.\n\n\nMobile security\nMobile security encompasses cybersecurity tools and practices specific to smartphones and other mobile devices, including mobile application management (MAM) and enterprise mobility management (EMM).\nMore recently, organizations are adopting unified endpoint management (UEM) solutions that allow them to protect, configure and manage all endpoint devices, including mobile devices, from a single console."

    "text": "Common cybersecurity threats\nSome of the most common types of cyberthreats include\n\nMalware\nRansomware\nPhishing\nCredential theft and abuse\nInsider threats\nAI attacks\nCryptojacking\nDistributed denial of service (DDoS)\n\n\n\nMalware\nMalware, short for ‚Äúmalicious software‚Äù, is any software code or computer program that is intentionally written to harm a computer system or its users. Almost every modern¬†cyberattack¬†involves some type of malware.\nHackers and cybercriminals create and use malware to gain unauthorized access to computer systems and sensitive data, hijack computer systems and operate them remotely, disrupt or damage computer systems, or hold data or systems hostage for large sums of money (see ‚ÄúRansomware‚Äù).\n\n\nRansomware\nRansomware is a type of malware that encrypts a victim‚Äôs data or device and threatens to keep it encrypted‚Äîor worse‚Äîunless the victim pays a ransom to the attacker.\nThe earliest ransomware attacks demanded a ransom in exchange for the encryption key required to unlock the victim‚Äôs data. Starting around 2019, almost all ransomware attacks were double extortion attacks that also threatened to publicly share victims‚Äô data; some triple extortion attacks added the threat of a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack.\nMore recently, ransomware attacks are on the decline. According to the IBM X-Force Threat Intelligence Index 2024, ransomware attacks accounted for 20% of all attacks in 2023, down 11.5% from 2022. The decline is likely the result of improved ransomware prevention, more effective law enforcement intervention and data backup and protection practices that enable businesses to recover without paying the ransom.\nIn the meantime, ransomware attackers have repurposed their resources to start other types of cyberthreats, including infostealer malware that allows attackers to steal data and hold it hostage without locking down the victim‚Äôs systems and data destruction attacks that destroy or threaten to destroy data for specific purposes.\n\n\nPhishing\nPhishing attacks are email, text or voice messages that trick users into downloading malware, sharing sensitive information or sending funds to the wrong people.\nMost users are familiar with bulk phishing scams‚Äîmass-mailed fraudulent messages that appear to be from a large and trusted brand, asking recipients to reset their passwords or reenter credit card information. More sophisticated phishing scams, such as spear phishing and business email compromise (BEC), target specific individuals or groups to steal especially valuable data or large sums of money.\nPhishing is just one type of social engineering, a class of ‚Äúhuman hacking‚Äù tactics and interactive attacks that use psychological manipulation to pressure people into taking unwise actions.\n\n\nCredential theft and account abuse\nThe X-Force Threat Intelligence Index found that identity-based attacks, which hijack legitimate user accounts and abuse their privileges, account for 30% of attacks. This makes identity-based attacks the most common entry point into corporate networks.\nHackers have many techniques for stealing credentials and taking over accounts. For example, Kerberoasting attacks manipulate the Kerberos authentication protocol commonly used in Microsoft Active Directory to seize privileged service accounts. In 2023, the IBM X-Force team experienced a 100% increase in Kerberoasting incidents.\nSimilarly, the X-Force team saw a 266% increase in the use of infostealer malware that secretly records user credentials and other sensitive data.\n\n\nInsider threats\nInsider threats are threats that originate with authorized users‚Äîemployees, contractors, business partners‚Äîwho intentionally or accidentally misuse their legitimate access or have their accounts hijacked by cybercriminals.\nInsider threats can be harder to detect than external threats because they have the earmarks of authorized activity and are invisible to antivirus software, firewalls and other security solutions that block external attacks.\n\n\nAI attacks\nMuch like cybersecurity professionals are using AI to strengthen their defenses, cybercriminals are using AI to conduct advanced attacks.\nIn generative AI fraud, scammers use generative AI to produce fake emails, applications and other business documents to fool people into sharing sensitive data or sending money.\nThe X-Force Threat Intelligence Index reports that scammers can use open source generative AI tools to craft convincing phishing emails in as little as five minutes. For comparison, it takes scammers 16 hours to come up with the same message manually.\nHackers are also using organizations‚Äô AI tools as attack vectors. For example, in prompt injection attacks, threat actors use malicious inputs to manipulate generative AI systems into leaking sensitive data, spreading misinformation or worse.\n\n\nCryptojacking\nCryptojacking happens when hackers gain access to an endpoint device and secretly use its computing resources to mine cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, ether or monero.\nSecurity analysts identified cryptojacking as a cyberthreat around 2011, shortly after the introduction of cryptocurrency. According to the IBM X-Force Threat Intelligence Index, cryptojacking is now among the top three areas of operations for cybercriminals.\n\n\nDistributed denial of service (DDoS)\nA DDoS attack attempts to crash a server, website or network by overloading it with traffic, usually from a botnet‚Äîa network of distributed systems that a cybercriminal hijacks by using malware and remote-controlled operations.\nThe global volume of DDoS attacks spiked during the COVID-19 pandemic. Increasingly, attackers are combining DDoS attacks with ransomware attacks, or simply threatening to launch DDoS attacks unless the target pays a ransom."

    "text": "Cybersecurity myths\nDespite an ever-increasing volume of cybersecurity incidents worldwide and the insights gleaned from resolving these incidents, some misconceptions persist. Some of the most dangerous include:\n\nStrong passwords are adequate protection\nStrong passwords do make a difference; for example, a 12-character password takes 62 trillion times longer to crack than a 6-character password. But passwords are relatively easy to acquire in other ways, such as through social engineering, keylogging malware, buying them on the dark web or paying disgruntled insiders to steal them.\n\n\nMost cybersecurity risks are well-known\nIn fact, the cyberthreat landscape is constantly changing. Thousands of new vulnerabilities are reported in old and new applications and devices every year. Opportunities for human error‚Äîspecifically by negligent employees or contractors who unintentionally cause a data breach‚Äîkeep increasing.\n\n\nAll cyberattack vectors are contained\nCybercriminals find new attack vectors all the time. The rise of AI technologies, operational technology (OT), Internet of Things (IoT) devices and cloud environments all give hackers new opportunities to cause trouble.\n\n\nMy industry is safe\nEvery industry has its share of cybersecurity risks. For example, ransomware attacks are targeting more sectors than ever, including local governments, nonprofits and healthcare providers. Attacks on supply chains, ‚Äú.gov‚Äù websites and critical infrastructure have also increased.\n\n\nCybercriminals don‚Äôt attack small businesses\nYes, they do. The Hiscox Cyber Readiness Report¬†found that almost half (41%) of small businesses in the US experienced a cyberattack in the last year."

    "text": "Key cybersecurity best practices and technologies\nWhile each organization‚Äôs cybersecurity strategy differs, many use these tools and tactics to reduce vulnerabilities, prevent attacks and intercept attacks in progress:\n\nSecurity awareness training\nData security tools\nIdentity and access management\nThreat detection and response\nDisaster recovery\n\n\nSecurity awareness training\nSecurity awareness training helps users understand how seemingly harmless actions‚Äîfrom using the same simple password for multiple log-ins to oversharing on social media‚Äîincrease their own or their organization‚Äôs risk of attack.\nCombined with thought-out¬†data security¬†policies, security awareness training can help employees protect sensitive personal and organizational data. It can also help them recognize and avoid phishing and malware attacks.\n\n\nData security tools\nData security tools, such as¬†encryption¬†and¬†data loss prevention¬†(DLP) solutions, can help stop security threats in progress or mitigate their effects. For example, DLP tools can detect and block attempted data theft, while encryption can make it so that any data that hackers steal is useless to them.\n\n\nIdentity and access management\nIdentity and access management (IAM)¬†refers to the tools and strategies that control how users access resources and what they can do with those resources.\nIAM technologies can help protect against account theft. For example,¬†multifactor authentication¬†requires users to supply multiple credentials to log in, meaning threat actors need more than just a password to break into an account.\nLikewise, adaptive authentication systems detect when users are engaging in risky behavior and raise additional authentication challenges before allowing them to proceed. Adaptive authentication can help limit the¬†lateral movement¬†of hackers who make it into the system.\nA¬†zero trust¬†architecture is one way to enforce strict access controls by verifying all connection requests between users and devices, applications and data.\n\n\nAttack surface management\nAttack surface management (ASM)¬†is the continuous discovery, analysis, remediation and monitoring of the cybersecurity vulnerabilities and potential attack vectors that make up an organization‚Äôs¬†attack surface.\nUnlike other cyberdefense disciplines, ASM is conducted entirely from a hacker‚Äôs perspective rather than the perspective of the defender. It identifies targets and assesses risks based on the opportunities they present to a malicious attacker.\n\n\nThreat detection and response\nAnalytics- and AI-driven technologies can help identify and respond to attacks in progress. These technologies can include¬†security information and event management (SIEM),¬†security orchestration, automation and response (SOAR)¬†and¬†endpoint detection and response (EDR). Typically, organizations use these technologies as part of a formal¬†incident response¬†plan.\n\n\nDisaster recovery\nDisaster recovery¬†capabilities can play a key role in maintaining business continuity and remediating threats in the event of a cyberattack. For example, the ability to fail over to a backup that is hosted in a remote location can help a business resume operations after a ransomware attack (sometimes without paying a ransom)"
