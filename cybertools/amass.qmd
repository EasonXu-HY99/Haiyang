## Introduction

In the realm of information security reconnaissance, OWASP Amass stands as one of the most powerful and comprehensive tools available for DNS enumeration and network mapping. Developed under the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) banner, Amass has become an essential component in the toolkit of security professionals, penetration testers, and bug bounty hunters who need to understand the external attack surface of an organization.

## What is OWASP Amass?

Amass is an open-source reconnaissance tool that helps security professionals map an organization's external network perimeter by collecting information from various sources. Unlike simple DNS enumeration tools, Amass uses a combination of techniques including:

-   DNS enumeration
-   Web scraping
-   Search engine results
-   Certificate transparency logs
-   API integrations
-   Active reconnaissance methods

The tool is designed to discover subdomains, IP addresses, ASNs (Autonomous System Numbers), and other network-related information that helps define an organization's attack surface.

## Core Features

### Comprehensive Discovery Methods

Amass leverages numerous techniques to ensure thorough reconnaissance:

| Method           | Description                                         |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **DNS**          | Zone transfers, brute forcing, permutation scanning |
| **Scraping**     | Web content analysis for subdomain references       |
| **APIs**         | Integration with numerous third-party data sources  |
| **Certificates** | Analysis of TLS certificate transparency logs       |
| **Archives**     | Historical data from web archives                   |
| **OSINT**        | Open-source intelligence gathering                  |

::: callout-note
Amass can perform both passive (non-intrusive) and active reconnaissance, giving users control over their footprint during testing.
:::

### Data Sources

Amass integrates with over 55 different external data sources, including:

-   Search engines (Google, Bing, Yahoo)
-   Certificate transparency logs (Censys, Crtsh)
-   Web archives (Wayback Machine)
-   DNS databases (SecurityTrails, PassiveTotal)
-   WHOIS information providers
-   IP data sources (Shodan, Censys)

### Visualization Capabilities

One of Amass's most powerful features is its ability to visualize network infrastructure relationships:

![Amass Visualization Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OWASP/Amass/master/images/maltego_results.png){fig-align="center" width="700"}

The tool can generate various output formats that enable users to create detailed maps of discovered assets and their relationships.

## Installation

Amass can be installed on various platforms:

### Linux

``` bash
# Using Snapcraft
sudo snap install amass

# Using apt (Kali Linux)
sudo apt install amass

# Using Go
GO111MODULE=on go get -v github.com/OWASP/Amass/v3/...

## Basic Usage

### Command Structure

Amass organizes its functionality into subcommands:

```         
amass [subcommand] [options] -d domain.com
```

Key subcommands include:

-   `intel`: Collect intelligence like ASNs, CIDRs, and netblocks
-   `enum`: Perform thorough DNS enumeration (the most commonly used command)
-   `viz`: Generate visualizations of discovered assets
-   `track`: Track differences between enumerations
-   `db`: Manage the Amass graph database

### Subdomain Enumeration

The most common use case is basic subdomain enumeration:

``` bash
# Basic enumeration
amass enum -d example.com

# More thorough enumeration with brute forcing
amass enum -brute -min-for-recursive 2 -d example.com

# Multiple target domains
amass enum -d example.com,example.org,example.net
```

![Amass Basic Enumeration](https://assets.danielmiessler.com/images/53fd5bf8-3bdd-41dd-9279-45a27470f9c7-amass-enum-ip.png){fig-align="center" width="700"}

### Intelligence Gathering

To gather broader intelligence about an organization:

``` bash
# Discover ASNs related to an organization
amass intel -org "Target Organization"

# Find domains associated with specific netblocks
amass intel -asn 15169,13414

# Reverse WHOIS lookups
amass intel -whois -d example.com
```

## Advanced Techniques

### Configuration Files

For more complex scans, Amass supports configuration files in YAML format:

``` yaml
# Example config.yaml
output_directory: /path/to/output/directory
maximum_dns_queries: 20000
scope:
  domains:
    - example.com
    - example.org
  excluded:
    - test.example.com
sources:
  shodan:
    apikey: SHODAN_API_KEY
  securitytrails:
    apikey: SECURITYTRAILS_API_KEY
```

Usage:

``` bash
amass enum -config config.yaml
```

### Rate Limiting

To be respectful of external services and avoid IP blocks:

``` bash
# Set maximum DNS queries per minute
amass enum -max-dns-queries 500 -d example.com

# Slow down the enumeration process
amass enum -timeout 60 -d example.com
```

### Output Formats

Amass supports various output formats for integration with other tools:

``` bash
# JSON output
amass enum -d example.com -json example_results.json

# Text output with IP addresses
amass enum -d example.com -ip -o example_results.txt

# Log all found names
amass enum -d example.com -log amass.log
```

## Visualization and Analysis

### Creating Network Graphs

One of Amass's most powerful features is its ability to generate visualizations:

``` bash
# Generate a D3.js visualization
amass viz -d3 -d example.com

# Generate a Gephi visualization
amass viz -gephi example_graph.gexf -d example.com
```

![Amass Network Graph](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OWASP/Amass/master/images/example_graphDB.png){fig-align="center" width="700"}

### Database Operations

Amass maintains a local graph database of results that can be queried:

``` bash
# List all enumeration IDs
amass db -list

# Show domains for a specific enumeration
amass db -show -enum 123

# Get subdomains found in an enumeration
amass db -names -enum 123
```

## Integration with Other Tools

Amass outputs can be piped into other security tools for further analysis:

### Combining with Nmap

``` bash
# Perform enumeration and scan discovered hosts
amass enum -ip -d example.com | awk '{print $2}' | sort -u | nmap -sV -iL -
```

### Feeding into Nuclei

``` bash
# Use discovered subdomains for vulnerability scanning
amass enum -d example.com | nuclei -t nuclei-templates/
```

### Building Recon Pipelines

Amass can be a key component in automated reconnaissance pipelines:

![Recon Pipeline](https://epi052.gitlab.io/notes-to-self/img/luigi/joined-task-depends.png){fig-align="center" width="700"}

``` bash
#!/bin/bash
# Simple recon pipeline
amass enum -d $TARGET -o domains.txt
cat domains.txt | httprobe > live_domains.txt
cat live_domains.txt | waybackurls > urls.txt
```

## Real-World Examples

### Bug Bounty Hunting

Bug bounty hunters use Amass to map target infrastructure:

1.  Identify all subdomains in scope
2.  Discover forgotten or development assets
3.  Map relationships between different parts of the infrastructure
4.  Find potential security gaps at the edges of the network

### Security Assessments

Security professionals leverage Amass during external assessments:

``` bash
# Comprehensive assessment example
amass enum -active -brute -min-for-recursive 3 -d example.com -o domains.txt

# Extract live web services
cat domains.txt | httprobe -c 50 > live_domains.txt

# Screenshot discovered services
cat live_domains.txt | aquatone -out example_screenshots

# Perform vulnerability scanning
cat live_domains.txt | nuclei -t cves/ -o vulnerabilities.txt
```

## Performance Optimization

### Resource Management

Amass can be resource-intensive. Consider these optimization techniques:

::: callout-warning
On systems with limited resources, Amass may consume significant CPU and memory, especially during large enumerations. Monitor system performance during intensive scans.
:::

``` bash
# Limit concurrent DNS queries
amass enum -max-dns-queries 500 -d example.com

# Adjust the number of resolvers
amass enum -resolvers resolvers.txt -d example.com
```

### Custom Wordlists

For more effective brute forcing:

``` bash
# Use a custom wordlist for subdomain brute forcing
amass enum -brute -w custom_wordlist.txt -d example.com
```

## Ethical Considerations

::: callout-warning
## Responsible Usage

Amass is a powerful reconnaissance tool intended for legitimate security testing with proper authorization. Unauthorized scanning may violate computer crime laws and network policies.
:::

Guidelines for ethical use:

1.  **Always obtain permission** before scanning an organization
2.  **Document scope and boundaries** clearly
3.  **Be mindful of rate limits** and resource utilization
4.  **Respect output data confidentiality**
5.  **Report security issues responsibly**
