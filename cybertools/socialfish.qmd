## Advanced Techniques

For experienced security professionals, SocialFish offers advanced capabilities:

### Custom Templates

Create personalized phishing templates tailored to specific organizations:

```python
# Example template configuration
template = {
    "name": "Corporate Portal",
    "path": "./templates/custom/corporate",
    "url": "https://company-portal.example",
    "module": "custom_module"
}
```

### API Integration

SocialFish can be integrated with other security tools through its API:

```python
import requests

# Example API call to SocialFish
api_key = "your_api_key_here"
endpoint = "http://localhost:8080/api/campaigns"
headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}"}

response = requests.get(endpoint, headers=headers)
campaigns = response.json()
```

## Ethical Considerations

SocialFish is a powerful tool that should be used responsibly and ethically:

- **Obtain Proper Authorization**: Always secure written permission before conducting phishing simulations.
- **Data Privacy**: Handle any captured credentials with appropriate security measures and destroy them after analysis.
- **Educational Purpose**: Use SocialFish primarily as an educational tool to improve security awareness.
- **Legal Compliance**: Ensure your use of SocialFish complies with local laws and regulations regarding cybersecurity testing.

## Case Study: Improving Corporate Security

In 2024, a Fortune 500 company used SocialFish to evaluate their employees' susceptibility to phishing attacks. The results were illuminating:

- 23% of employees entered credentials on the phishing page
- 12% provided complete sets of information including two-factor authentication codes
- Departments with recent security training showed 76% lower click-through rates

Following the assessment, the company implemented targeted security awareness training, resulting in an 82% reduction in successful phishing attempts in subsequent tests.
