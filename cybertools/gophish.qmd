## Security Considerations

When using GoPhish for security testing, consider these important factors:

- **Legal authorization**: Always obtain proper authorization before conducting phishing tests
- **Scope definition**: Clearly define test parameters and communicate them to stakeholders
- **Data protection**: Handle all collected data according to relevant privacy regulations
- **Educational focus**: Emphasize the educational aspect of campaigns over punitive measures

## Advanced Configuration

GoPhish can be customized for more complex testing scenarios:

```yaml
admin_server:
  listen_url: 0.0.0.0:3333
  use_tls: true
  cert_path: example.crt
  key_path: example.key

phish_server:
  listen_url: 0.0.0.0:80
  use_tls: false

database:
  name: sqlite3
  path: gophish.db

logging:
  filename: gophish.log
  level: info
```

## Integration with Other Tools

GoPhish works well with other security tools and can be integrated into broader security testing frameworks:

- **SIEM systems**: Feed phishing exercise data into security information and event management tools
- **Training platforms**: Connect with security awareness training solutions
- **Automation tools**: Use the API to automate campaign creation and reporting

## Conclusion

GoPhish represents an essential tool in the modern security professional's arsenal. By conducting regular phishing simulations, organizations can identify vulnerabilities in their human security layer and develop targeted training programs to address these weaknesses.
