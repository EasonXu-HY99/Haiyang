## Introduction to Censys

Censys is a leading Internet security and attack surface management platform that provides comprehensive visibility into an organization's digital assets. Founded in 2015 as a research project at the University of Michigan, Censys has evolved into a powerful cybersecurity tool used by security professionals worldwide to discover, monitor, and analyze internet-exposed assets.

## Key Features and Capabilities

### Internet-Wide Scanning

Censys continuously scans the entire IPv4 address space, collecting detailed information about internet-connected devices, services, and systems. This comprehensive scanning provides:

-   Discovery of all public-facing assets
-   Identification of open ports and running services
-   Detection of security vulnerabilities and misconfigurations
-   Certificate and cryptographic protocol information

### Attack Surface Management

    <p>Censys Attack Surface Management (ASM) platform helps organizations:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Discover unknown and shadow IT assets</li>
      <li>Monitor cloud infrastructure and IoT devices</li>
      <li>Identify potential security risks before attackers</li>
      <li>Track digital asset inventory over time</li>
      <li>Receive alerts on critical security issues</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>
```

### Certificate Intelligence

Censys provides detailed information about SSL/TLS certificates across the internet, enabling:

-   Monitoring of certificate validity and expiration
-   Identification of certificate authorities and issuers
-   Tracking certificate deployments across your infrastructure
-   Detection of fraudulent or malicious certificates

## Using Censys for Security Research

### Search Capabilities

Censys offers powerful search functionality to query its extensive database:

``` python
from censys.search import CensysHosts

h = CensysHosts()

# Search for hosts with specific service
query = "services.service_name: ELASTICSEARCH"
results = h.search(query, per_page=10)

for host in results:
    print(f"Found host: {host['ip']}")
    for service in host.get("services", []):
        print(f"  Service: {service.get('service_name', 'unknown')}")
        print(f"  Port: {service.get('port', 'unknown')}")
```

### Sample Queries

Here are some useful Censys search queries for security professionals:

| Purpose | Query |
|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Find vulnerable systems | `services.software.product: "Apache" AND services.software.version: /2\.4\.4[9]?/` |
| Identify exposed databases | `services.service_name: MONGODB AND NOT services.mongodb.authentication.enabled: true` |
| Detect misconfigured web servers | `services.http.response.headers.server: "nginx" AND services.http.response.status_code: 500` |
| Find IoT devices | `services.service_name: "Dahua DVR"` |

## Practical Applications

### Vulnerability Management

Security teams use Censys to:

-   Identify vulnerable systems before they can be exploited
-   Track exposure to new CVEs across their infrastructure
-   Verify remediation efforts are complete
-   Monitor third-party vendor security posture

### Threat Intelligence

Censys data powers threat intelligence by:

-   Identifying command & control infrastructure
-   Tracking attacker infrastructure changes
-   Supporting attribution of malicious activity
-   Providing context for observed indicators of compromise

### Compliance Monitoring

Organizations leverage Censys for compliance by:

-   Maintaining accurate inventory of internet-facing assets
-   Ensuring proper SSL/TLS configuration
-   Detecting unauthorized services and shadow IT
-   Documenting security controls for auditors

## Getting Started with Censys

### API Integration

Integrating with the Censys API is straightforward:

``` python
from censys.search import CensysHosts
import os

# Set your API credentials
API_ID = os.environ.get("CENSYS_API_ID")
API_SECRET = os.environ.get("CENSYS_API_SECRET")

# Initialize the client
h = CensysHosts(api_id=API_ID, api_secret=API_SECRET)

# Create a simple report of your assets
results = h.search("services.service_name: HTTP", per_page=100)

http_versions = {}
for host in results:
    for service in host.get("services", []):
        if service.get("service_name") == "HTTP":
            server = service.get("http", {}).get("response", {}).get("headers", {}).get("server", "Unknown")
            if server in http_versions:
                http_versions[server] += 1
            else:
                http_versions[server] = 1

print("Web Server Distribution:")
for server, count in http_versions.items():
    print(f"  {server}: {count}")
```

### Subscription Options

Censys offers several subscription tiers to meet different needs:

1.  **Free** - Basic search access with limited results
