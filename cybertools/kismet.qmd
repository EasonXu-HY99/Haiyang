## Introduction to Kismet

Kismet is a powerful open-source wireless network detector, sniffer, and intrusion detection system. Unlike many other wireless tools that focus solely on Wi-Fi networks, Kismet can work with multiple interface types simultaneously, including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, software-defined radio (SDR), and various other RF systems.

![Kismet Interface](/api/placeholder/800/450)

What sets Kismet apart from other wireless network tools is its passive monitoring capability. While many tools actively probe networks, Kismet operates silently by default, making it ideal for security research, network mapping, and wardriving without alerting network administrators to your presence.

## Key Features of Kismet

Kismet offers an extensive feature set that makes it a versatile tool for wireless network analysis:

- **Passive network detection**: Discovers networks without sending probe requests
- **Multi-interface support**: Works with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, and other RF interfaces
- **Distributed operation**: Deploy multiple sensors reporting to a central server
- **Web-based interface**: Modern, responsive UI accessible from any device
- **JSON-based API**: Allows integration with other tools and custom applications
- **GPS integration**: Maps discovered networks to physical locations
- **Traffic logging**: Captures packets for later analysis
- **Intrusion detection**: Identifies potential attacks against wireless networks
- **Plugin system**: Extendable functionality through plugins

## System Architecture

Kismet uses a client-server architecture that consists of three main components:

1. **Kismet Server**: The core component that processes data from capture sources
2. **Capture Sources**: Hardware interfaces that collect wireless data
3. **Clients**: Interfaces for viewing and interacting with collected data

![Kismet Architecture Diagram](/api/placeholder/800/400)

This architecture allows Kismet to:

- Run capture sources on remote devices
- Process data centrally
- Provide access to multiple users simultaneously
- Scale from single-device usage to enterprise deployments

# Clone the repository
git clone https://www.kismetwireless.net/git/kismet.git

# Configure and compile
cd kismet
./configure
make -j$(nproc)

# Install
sudo make install
```

### Kali Linux

Kismet comes pre-installed on Kali Linux, but you may want to update to the latest version:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install kismet
```

### From Package Repositories

For stable but potentially older versions:

```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt install kismet

# Fedora
sudo dnf install kismet

# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S kismet
```

## Initial Configuration

After installation, you need to configure Kismet before first use:

1. **Create configuration directory**:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.kismet/
```

2. **Set up user permissions** (to run without root):

```bash
sudo usermod -aG kismet $USER
sudo chmod 650 /etc/kismet/kismet.conf
sudo chown root:kismet /etc/kismet/kismet.conf
```

3. **Log out and log back in** for group changes to take effect

## Basic Usage

### Starting Kismet

The simplest way to start Kismet is:

```bash
kismet
```

By default, Kismet will:
- Start the server
- Launch the web interface on http://localhost:2501
- Prompt you to add capture sources

![Kismet Startup Screen](/api/placeholder/800/450)

### Adding Capture Sources

Capture sources can be added in several ways:

1. **Through the web interface**:
   - Navigate to http://localhost:2501
   - Go to "Data Sources"
   - Click "Add Source"
   - Select your interface type

2. **From the command line**:

```bash
# Add a Wi-Fi interface
kismet -c wlan0

# Add multiple interfaces
kismet -c wlan0 -c wlan1

# Add a specific interface type
kismet -c rtl433:device=0
```

## The Kismet Web UI

The modern Kismet web interface provides a comprehensive view of your wireless environment:

### Dashboard

The main dashboard shows an overview of:
- Active devices
- Packet rates
- Signal strengths
- Alerts
- GPS data (if enabled)

![Kismet Dashboard](/api/placeholder/800/450)

### Devices View

The devices view lists all discovered wireless devices with detailed information:
- SSID and BSSID
- Channel and frequency
- Encryption type
- Signal strength
- Client connections
- First and last seen times

### Channel Utilization

This view shows RF spectrum usage across channels:
- Heat maps of channel activity
- Packet counts per channel
- Signal levels

![Channel Utilization Graph](/api/placeholder/800/400)

## Advanced Features

### GPS Integration

Kismet can integrate with GPS devices to map discovered networks:

```bash
# Start Kismet with GPSD
kismet -c wlan0 --gps gpsd:host=localhost,port=2947
```

The resulting data can be exported in KML format for viewing in Google Earth or other mapping applications.

### PCAP Logging

Kismet can log captured packets for later analysis:

```bash
# Enable full packet capture
kismet -c wlan0 --log-packets
```

Captured files can be analyzed with tools like Wireshark.

### Remote Capture

Kismet's remote capture capability allows distributed sensor deployment:

1. **On the sensor device**:

```bash
# Start a remote capture source
kismet_cap_linux_wifi --connect=[server IP]:3501 --source=wlan0:name=remote1
```

2. **On the server**:
   - Configure to accept remote connections
   - Authenticate remote sensors

This architecture is ideal for large-scale wireless monitoring.

## Specialized Use Cases

### Bluetooth Scanning

Kismet supports Bluetooth scanning with compatible hardware:

```bash
# Add a Bluetooth interface
kismet -c hci0
```

This allows detection of:
- Bluetooth Classic devices
- Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices
- Bluetooth device names and advertised services

### Zigbee and IoT Detection

With appropriate hardware (like a Texas Instruments CC2531), Kismet can detect:

```bash
# Add a Zigbee interface
kismet -c ti_cc_2531:device=/dev/ttyACM0
```

This functionality is valuable for IoT security assessments.

### Software-Defined Radio Integration

Kismet integrates with SDR devices to detect non-standard wireless protocols:

```bash
# Add RTL-SDR for various protocols
kismet -c rtl433:device=0
```

This can detect:
- Weather stations
- Car key fobs
- Wireless doorbells
- Other ISM band devices

## Wardriving with Kismet

Wardriving is the act of mapping wireless networks over a geographical area. Kismet excels at this task:

### Required Equipment

- Laptop or Raspberry Pi
- Compatible wireless adapter(s)
- GPS receiver
- External antenna (optional but recommended)
- Power supply (battery pack for mobility)

### Setup Process

1. **Configure GPS integration**:

```bash
# Edit kismet.conf
gps=gpsd:host=localhost,port=2947
```

2. **Create a logging directory**:

```bash
mkdir ~/wardriving
```

3. **Start Kismet with appropriate options**:

```bash
kismet -c wlan0 -t ~/wardriving/$(date +%Y-%m-%d) --log-prefix "wardriving"
```

### Analyzing Results

After a wardriving session, the collected data can be:
- Converted to KML format for Google Earth
- Uploaded to services like WiGLE
- Analyzed for statistics on encryption usage
- Mapped to identify coverage patterns
