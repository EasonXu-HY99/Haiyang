## Introduction to Sleuth Kit

The Sleuth Kit (TSK) is an open-source collection of command-line tools and a C library that allows investigators to analyze disk images and recover files in digital forensics investigations. Often used alongside Autopsy, its graphical interface, Sleuth Kit is a go-to solution for law enforcement, security professionals, and researchers. This page explores its features, uses, and capabilities.

## Core Features of Sleuth Kit

Sleuth Kit provides a robust set of tools for forensic analysis:

### File System Analysis

-   Supports multiple file systems, including NTFS, FAT, ext2/ext3/ext4, and HFS+.
-   Recovers deleted files and examines file metadata.

### Disk Image Support

-   Works with raw disk images (e.g., `.dd` files) and other formats.
-   Extracts data from partitions and volumes.

### Timeline Generation

-   Creates timelines of file activity to reconstruct events.

## How Sleuth Kit Works

Sleuth Kit operates by processing disk images or live systems at a low level. Investigators use its command-line tools—like `mmls` (to list partitions), `fsstat` (file system details), and `fls` (list files)—to extract and analyze data. This modular approach makes it highly customizable and scriptable for complex investigations.

## Use Cases

-   **Criminal Investigations**: Recover evidence from suspect devices.
-   **Data Recovery**: Retrieve lost or deleted files for non-forensic purposes.
-   **Security Research**: Analyze malware or breaches by examining file system artifacts.
