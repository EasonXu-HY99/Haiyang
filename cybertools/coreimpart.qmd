### Workspace Management

The workspace serves as the central repository for all testing activities:

```python
# Example Python API interaction with Core Impact workspace
from coreimpact import Workspace, Target, Exploit

# Initialize workspace
workspace = Workspace("Corporate Network Assessment")

# Add target
target = Target("192.168.1.0/24")
workspace.add_target(target)

# Run exploit
exploit = Exploit("ms17-010-eternalblue")
result = exploit.run(target="192.168.1.25")

if result.success:
    print("Exploitation successful")
    shell = result.get_shell()
    output = shell.execute("whoami")
    print(f"Running as: {output}")
```

### Agent Technology

Core Impact's agents are the platform's eyes and ears within compromised systems:

- Stealthy deployment
- Encrypted communication
- Modular capabilities
- Automatic cleanup

### Reporting Engine

Comprehensive reporting is a key strength of Core Impact:

- Executive summaries
- Technical findings
- Remediation recommendations
- Compliance mappings
