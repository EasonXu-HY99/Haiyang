## Operational Modes

### 1. Local System Cracking

-   Direct SAM file analysis
-   Mounted system volume investigation

### 2. Live CD/USB Cracking

-   Bootable recovery environment
-   No installation required
-   Supports multiple Windows versions

## Rainbow Table Strategy

### Understanding Rainbow Tables

Rainbow tables are pre-computed hash tables that dramatically accelerate password recovery: - Reduce computational complexity - Trade storage space for processing speed - Enable rapid hash-to-password conversion

``` bash
# Sample rainbow table types
- Small tables (fast, limited coverage)
- Extensive tables (comprehensive, larger size)
```

## Performance Characteristics

## Practical Scenarios

### 1. System Recovery

-   Lost administrator passwords
-   Corporate system access restoration
-   Forensic password investigation

### 2. Security Auditing

-   Evaluate password complexity
-   Identify weak authentication mechanisms
-   Demonstrate potential vulnerabilities

## Ethical Considerations

::: callout-warning
Ophcrack should **exclusively** be used: - With explicit system owner consent - On personally owned systems - For legitimate recovery purposes - In controlled, authorized environments
:::

## Advanced Configuration

### Customization Options

-   Custom rainbow table integration
-   Configurable cracking parameters
-   Selective hash targeting

``` bash
# Advanced configuration example
ophcrack -t custom-tables.rt -f samfile.txt
```
