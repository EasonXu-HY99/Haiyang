## Introduction to OSINT Framework

The OSINT Framework is a comprehensive collection of open-source intelligence tools and resources organized in a user-friendly, interactive web interface. Created by Justin Nordine, this framework serves as a roadmap for investigators, security professionals, researchers, and journalists to navigate the vast landscape of publicly available information gathering resources.

OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) refers to intelligence collected from publicly available sources, including the internet, media, public government data, professional and academic publications, and commercial data. The OSINT Framework aggregates these resources into a structured format, making it easier to discover and utilize the appropriate tools for specific intelligence gathering needs.

## Core Components and Organization

The OSINT Framework is organized into a hierarchical structure with main categories branching into subcategories and specific tools. This organization allows users to quickly navigate to the resources relevant to their specific intelligence gathering objectives.

### Interactive Structure

The framework provides an interactive tree structure that expands as users click through categories, revealing subcategories and specific tools. This design allows for:

1.  Progressive disclosure of information
2.  Logical categorization of similar tools
3.  Quick navigation to relevant resources
4.  Visual representation of relationships between different OSINT areas

## Key OSINT Tools Highlighted

### Username Research Tools

The framework includes numerous tools for researching usernames across platforms:

``` python
import requests
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

def check_username(site, username):
    """Check if username exists on given site"""
    url = site['url_format'].format(username=username)
    try:
        response = requests.get(url, timeout=5)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            return (site['name'], url, True)
        return (site['name'], url, False)
    except:
        return (site['name'], url, "Error")

def search_username(username, sites_list):
    """Search username across multiple sites"""
    results = []
    with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=10) as executor:
        future_to_site = {executor.submit(check_username, site, username): site for site in sites_list}
        for future in future_to_site:
            try:
                results.append(future.result())
            except:
                pass
    return results

# Example usage
sites = [
    {"name": "Twitter", "url_format": "https://twitter.com/{username}"},
    {"name": "GitHub", "url_format": "https://github.com/{username}"},
    {"name": "Reddit", "url_format": "https://www.reddit.com/user/{username}"}
]

# In practice, OSINT Framework links to dedicated tools that perform this function
```

### Email Intelligence Tools

Several tools within the framework help investigate email addresses:

| Tool Name | Purpose | Features |
|--------------------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| Hunter.io | Email verification and discovery | Domain email patterns, verification, company insights |
| Epieos | Email OSINT | Social account discovery, breach checking |
| EmailRep | Reputation checking | Risk scoring, known malicious activity |
